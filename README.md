## Fibonacci Calculator 

This is the backend for the fibonacci calculator project, with a for loop we can determine the correct position of a number in a fibonacci sequence.

It is a simple express api, created with typescript, it uses an open cors policy because we are not dealing with important information.

**Have fun :)**
